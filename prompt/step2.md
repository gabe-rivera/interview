Please develop a simple web server written in Python or Go that pulls data from an open, free API like https://www.boredapi.com and renders some of the data using a templated (jinja2, GoTemplate, etc.) HTML file. There should be at least two endpoints -  one that displays a home page, and another that retrieves data from the API.
